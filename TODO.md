# TODO
  * ~~Make the code a little more of a framework than robot code~~
    * ~~Possibly make some things like PID more of a class than a namespace~~
    * Make using this library easy
      1. Makefile changes probably
      2. Moving init functions of namespaces to a file that a user would write
      3. Deleting opcontrol.cpp, auto.cpp and init.cpp
  * Get more members...?
  * Create a wiki
  * ~~Put library code in *alpaca* namespace, with an *alpaca::init* function to take care of the usual c++ stuff and motor init, etc~~
